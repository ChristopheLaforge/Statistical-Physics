    "### Objectives\n",
    "The objectives of this code is to generate a walk on a square lattice with does not intersect.<br>\n",
    "A brute force approach would be to move randomly on the square lattice and to test if the walk has alreaday passed throuugh the tentative new position. This is however inefficient for the reason that numerous attempt will failed because of bloccage. A bloccage is a situation where there is no next possible step to be taken by the random walk. It is trapped.<br>\n",
    "To avoid bloccage, we need to design a smarter algorithm that identify the situations that could lead to a bloccage and take the appropriate action to avoid them. This seems sensible but our implementation has an undesirable effect. Indeed, we have ignored the possible cases where the walk would take an action that could lead to a bloccage if the desired length of the walk would be big enough but could accomodate the input desired length. Said differently, our algorithm will avoid entering in a trap that would allow it to growth sufficiently to meet the desired total length. <br>\n",
    "The undesirable consequences of this implementation is therefore that we have a biais sample of the set of all possible SAW of a given length."
